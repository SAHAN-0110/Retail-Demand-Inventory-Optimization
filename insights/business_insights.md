# Retail Demand & Inventory Optimization – Business Insights

## Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates retail sales and inventory data to understand demand patterns and identify inventory-related risks. The objective was to minimize stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and support data-driven inventory planning. By combining sales trends with inventory levels, the analysis highlights where demand and supply are misaligned and proposes actionable improvements for inventory optimization.

## Key Findings
- Several products exhibit consistently high demand but maintain low inventory buffers, increasing stockout risk.
- A subset of products shows low demand velocity while holding high inventory levels, leading to inefficient cash utilization.
- Demand trends vary significantly by category, indicating the need for category-specific inventory strategies.
- Seasonal demand spikes suggest that static reorder policies may lead to missed sales opportunities.
- Inventory prioritization based on urgency scores helps identify products requiring immediate attention.

## Business Recommendations
